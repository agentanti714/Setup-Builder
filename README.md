**To use, open Setup.py**

All portable items are assumed to fit ideally (e.g. angel's always gets x150)

DO NOT USE COMMAS AS ANYTHING OTHER THAN SEPARATORS/DELIMITERS BETWEEN ENTRIES FOR .csv FILES

--------------------------------------------------
**items.csv**
- items.csv follows format: NAME, MULTI, LENGTH, WIDTH

- Width can use * to assume best case with fitting it around railgun corners

- Example entry:

  Quantum Clockwork,120,4,8

**placements.csv**
- placements.csv follows format: NAME, X, Y, 1st_OR_Any

- X, Y are relative to 1st dragon cannon, starting with 1.
- For example, a valid placement directly after a draogn cannon, on the same platform as the dragon cannon has X = 1, Y = 0.

- Example entry:
  
  Alien Relic,1,-1,Any

**portables.csv**
